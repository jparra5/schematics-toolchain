# IBM Schematics Terraform Template 

This repo contains an Tekton template for automating workflow with [IBM Cloud Schematics](http://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/), a service for managing infrastructure as code.  This template will configure a DevOps toolchain that will give you the option to invoke a delivery pipeline to update infrastructure automatically using the Terraform template's git repo.  

## Getting Started
1.  First, [create an IBM Cloud Schematics workspace](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/workspaces/create)
2. Once the Workspace is created, scroll down and click `Create Toolchain`.
3. Complete the toolchain setup form and click "Create" to create a toolchain.
4. Return to the workspace created, and import newly created Terraform Template git repo. *Might need to create an access token within Gitlab to import Template into Schematics Workspaces*

### To get started, click this button:

## Pipeline Details

### Schematics-Deploy Pipeline

The pipeline assumes a Schematics workspace already exists.  Follow the "Getting Started" section above to start by creating a Schematics workspace for you infrastructure as code/Terraform templates.

It implements the following best practices:
- Updates the Schematics workspace with any pipeline environment variables that match Terraform variables.  Any overrides to variables in the Schematics workspace should be done using environment variables on the delivery pipeline.
  - The "UPDATE" task will inspect the terraform template and iterate over template variables. 
  - If there is an environment variable that exactly matches the template variable, the Schematics workspace will be updated with the overriden values from the environment.
- Plan the changes to the infrastructure.  
- If the plan is successful, it will apply changes to the infrastructure.


### Schematics-PR

This pipeline listens for Pull Requests created against the `main` branch. The purpose of this pipeline is to pull source code and scan through the terraform files for compliance.

#### cra-terraform-scan
This task scans ibm-terraform-provider files for compliance issues.
